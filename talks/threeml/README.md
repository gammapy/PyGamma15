# Talk - Multi-mission maximum likelihood analysis with 3ML

* Presenter: [Luigi Tibaldo](https://github.com/tibaldo)
* Duration: 20 + 5 min

## Abstract

The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood [3ML](https://threeml.stanford.edu) project
aims at providing a common framework for joint analysis of sources combining
data from different multiwavelength/multimessenger instruments in a statistically consistent fashion. 3ML is
based on the likelihood formalism, in which a model summarizing our knowledge
about a particular region of the sky is convolved with the instrument response
and compared to the relevant data. The innovative architecture of 3ML employs
plugins to handle the instrument-specific part of the analysis based on the
existing/official software for each instrument. 3ML provides a variety of models
for the spectrum and morphology of the sources, and tools for likelihood
analysis based on either likelihood optimization or Bayesian sampling.

## Outline

* Motivations: why multi-mission analyses?
* Approaches: instrument response deconvolution versus model forward folding
* 3ML concept overview (plugins, models, analysis)
* frequentist versus Bayesian analysis 
* status of the 3ML software
* demo: analysis of a point source with Fermi and ...
* What can we work on this week?
